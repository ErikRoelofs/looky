MVP
- add a width/height type "cram" for easier labels
- fix aquarium to create a canvas once
- get it renamed to looky on git
- slotted view
- multiline text
- proper (default) signaling
- samples (remove existing junk, add real samples) (as separate projects)
  - simple 4pane V
  - shooter hud
  - rpg with dialogs
  - rts, C&C style V
  - collectible card game (magic battle mat like)
- bugfixes that result from the creation of samples
- docs


V2
- animation

Undetermined:
- scrolling views
- aquarium sorting
- gradient backgrounds
- rapid bootstrap
- fix "dict" validator  -> requires validating non-tables
- on-attach events, on-remove events? (although the view isn't aware of these and they could just be signals)
- extra schema options:
  - filter this table to meet this schema (may need more work)
- how to do signals returning from child to parent -> or just child adding itself as a payload? (but coords?)
- expressions in width/height?
