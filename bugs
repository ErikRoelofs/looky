- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium
  - scrollables (?)
  - grid

- think about animation -> this should probably be layouting-wrappers
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys -> once signaling works properly
- support image backgrounds -> also gradient ones?

? linear might need some extra layout options if it's the base layout
  ? or maybe even just add a few (more) layouting-wrappers (boundary, layouted-boundary, margin-simulators
