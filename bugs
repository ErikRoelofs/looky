- can we REALLY have two copies of the same view? what about width/height granted, for example?
  - should those be separate instances, then?
  - or should the width/height info not be stored on the child either? (but passed to draw?)
  - is this an architecture difference, or a performance difference only? < will definitely hit performance.

- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium
- needs LOADS of assertions and hints

- think about layoutgravity. I don't think it belongs on the child.
- all views need a translation function to convert screen-coords to local-coords and the other way around (from their parent)
- think about themes and styles
- think about animation
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys
- support image backgrounds
- move drawing of border/background to base
- now that margin is gone, move borders into the padding entirely
- clickviews violates principles
