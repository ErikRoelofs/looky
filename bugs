- can we REALLY have two copies of the same view? what about width/height granted, for example?
  - should those be separate instances, then?
  - or should the width/height info not be stored on the child either? (but passed to draw?)
  - is this an architecture difference, or a performance difference only? < will definitely hit performance.

- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium
  - scrollables (?)
  - grid
- needs LOADS of assertions and hints

- think about animation -> this should probably be layouting-wrappers
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys -> once signaling works properly
- support image backgrounds -> also gradient ones?
- linear might need some extra layout options if it's the base layout
  - or maybe even just add a few layouting-wrappers (boundary, layouted-boundary, margin-simulators

- there NEEDs to be a split between externalSignalHandlers and childSignalHandlers
  - but they need to work the same and probably should be mostly in separate tables (duplicated)
