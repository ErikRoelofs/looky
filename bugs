- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium (need schema)
  - scrollables (?)
  - grid (flex)

- think about animation -> this should probably be layouting-wrappers
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys -> once signaling works properly
  - need to support hover-start, hover-stop?
  - need to handle mouse-up on, mouse-down off a view
  - propagate mouse-signals to all children. but modify coordinates to local system
  - can handle special events in the child then
  - signalling default loader should modify the base constructor in some way, to include signals?
  - are x,y special payload variables? (ugly) how to deal with coordinate translations?
  
  
- support image backgrounds -> also gradient ones?

? linear might need some extra layout options if it's the base layout
  ? or maybe even just add a few (more) layouting-wrappers (boundary, layouted-boundary, margin-simulators
