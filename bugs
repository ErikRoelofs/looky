- linear and stack need to accept padding (and margin?) for themselves?
- root needs to behave more like base
- needs LOADS of assertions and hints
- think about margin/layoutgravity. I don't think they belong on the child.
- all views need a translation function to convert screen-coords to local-coords and the other way around (from their parent)
- think about themes and styles
- think about animation
- need default signal-handlers for common cases (to children, to out, to specific child)
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys
