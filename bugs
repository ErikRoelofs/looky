- upgrade core viewtypes
  - multiline text

- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium (need schema)
  - scrollables (?)
  - grid (flex)
  - slotted  

- think about animation -> this should probably be layouting-wrappers
  - also some baseviews like animatedImage, movingText, textPrinter
  - with signalSupport to control them
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys -> once signaling works properly
  - need to support hover-start, hover-stop? (or is that child resp?)
  - need to handle mouse-up on, mouse-down off a view (or just let child handle it based on coords)
  - propagate mouse-signals to all children. but modify coordinates to local system
  - signalling default loader should modify the base constructor in some way, to include signals?
  - are x,y special payload variables? (ugly) how to deal with coordinate translations?
  
  
- support image backgrounds -> also gradient ones?
