- imagehelper needs to have size passed to function, because methods differ

- upgrade core viewtypes
  - multiline text

- add core viewtypes:
  - aquarium (need schema) (need sorting)
  - scrollables (?)
  - grid (flex) (?) (or let the user use linears?)
  - slotted  

- think about animation -> this should probably be layouting-wrappers
  - also some baseviews like animatedImage, movingText, textPrinter
  - with signalSupport to control them
- need a complete default signaling-setup for clicks/keys -> once signaling works properly
  - propagate mouse-signals to all children. but modify coordinates to local system
  - signalling default loader should modify the base constructor in some way, to include signals?
  - are x,y special payload variables? (ugly) how to deal (properly) with coordinate translations?
  - each view with children needs translateCoordsToChild and translateCoordsFromChild function 
  
  
- support image backgrounds -> also gradient ones?
- get rid of repitition of image functions. (Use the better ones from background)
- draw images to canvas once!

- animation in multiple parts:
  - views with inherent animation (should be special viewtypes?)
  - views with basic view animation (ie; zoom, shake) (should be layout wrappers?)
  - views with appear/disappear/move animation 
    (should be controlled by an animation-layer?) (would need to be set to put it at the right z-index)
